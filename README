XU4
===

   "Prepare yourself for a grand adventure: Ultima IV, sixteen times
   larger than Ultima III, is a milestone in computer gaming.  Lord
   British has produced a game to challenge, not only your physical
   and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character.  The evil
   triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus, have been
   vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia.  Evil
   yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men.  A
   new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all
   frontiers through the mastery of both magic and the use of force.
   Daemons, dragons and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside
   and must be destroyed.  The seeker on the path of the avatar will
   faces hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive
   such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain.
   Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final
   conflict, where the ultimate challenge -- the self -- awaits..."
     -- Back cover of Ultima IV box

XU4 is a remake of the computer game Ultima IV.  The goal is to make
it easy and convenient to play this classic on modern operating
systems.  XU4 is primarily inspired by the much more ambitious project
Exult.  Linux is the primary development platform but it gets ported
to Windows and MacOS X regularly. It should be trivial to port to any
system with SDL support.

XU4 isn't a new game based on the Ultima IV story -- it is a faithful
recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics.  If you
are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
it -- yet.  New features that improve the gameplay and keep with the
spirit of the original game will be added.

XU4 also tries to maintain strict compatibility with the original for
its savegame files.  You can use a game saved in XU4 with the original
and vice versa, at least in theory.

   for now); the -scale parameter now accepts a number or "2xBi" for
   filtered scaling (2 is still the default, 2xBi looks bad without
   the VGA upgrade)

To do, in no particular order:
 - sound effects
 - autoconf, automake
 - everything else :)

Some thoughts for possible improvements:
 - Ultima 5 style aiming in combat (i.e. allow angle shots)
 - support for higher-resolution tile sets
 - allow the map view to display more of the world
 - automatically fetch Ultima 4 for DOS if not found
 - move hardcoded data (starting attributes, etc.)
   into xml config file
 - menu-based interface, like Sega version
 - improve the scalers:
   + scale entire screen image rather than individual tiles
   + correct for aspect ratio


COMPILING
---------

Note that you need libxml2, SDL, the SDL development libraries &
headers, and the SDL_mixer library to compile.  TiMidity++ may be
necessary on some platforms, too.  Assuming they are present, type
make in the src directory to build it.  An executable called u4 is
created.


RUNNING
-------

The actual data files from Ultima 4 are loaded at runtime, which means
that a copy of Ultima 4 for DOS must be present at runtime.
Fortunately, Ultima IV is available as closed-source freeware from
www.ultimaforever.com.

Download UltimaIV.zip and (optionally) u4upgrad.zip, and place them in
the same directory as the u4 executable.  xu4 will read the Ultima IV
data files straight out of the zipfile.

xu4 searches for the zipfiles, or the unpacked contents of the
zipfiles in the following places:
 - the current directory when u4 is run
 - a subdirectory named "ultima4" of the current directory
 - "/usr/lib/u4/ultima4/"
 - "/usr/local/lib/u4/ultima4/"

The zipfile doesn't need to be unpacked, but if it is, xu4 can handle
uppercase or lowercase filenames even on case-sensitive filesystems,
so it doesn't matter whether the files are named AVATAR.EXE or
avater.exe or even Avatar.exe.

At the title screen, a configuration menu can be accessed by pressing
'c'.  Here, the screen scale, filter, volume and other settings can be
modified.  Note: the game must be restarted for the new settings to
take effect.  These settings are stored in the file $HOME/.xu4rc.

xu4 also accepts the following command line options:

   -fullscreen      Fullscreen mode.
   -f

   -filter <str>    Apply a filter on the scaled images. The <str>
                    parameter must be set to one of the following
                    case-sensitive options:
                        point
                        2xBi
                        2xSaI
                        Scale2x

   -skipintro       Skip the intro, and go directly into the game.
   -i               This option requires the existance of a valid saved
                    game.

   -profile <str>   Activate a specific save game profile.  Using this
   -p <str>         option, you may have multiple saved games at the
                    same time.
                      * Use quotation marks around profile names that
                        include spaces.
                      * All profiles are stored in the "profiles"
                        sub-directory.
                      * The active profile name is shown on the
                        introduction map view off the main menu.

   -quiet           Quiet mode - no music.
   -q

   -scale <n>       Scale the original graphics by a factor of <n>.
                    Factor <n> must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   -verbose         Verbose output; prints out information useful for
   -v               trouble-shooting.


ULTIMA 4 DOCUMENTATION
----------------------

Included with Ultima 4 for DOS, as downloaded from one of the above
sites, are electronic copies of the printed documentation from the
original Ultima IV box.  HISTORY.TXT contains the "The History of
Britannia", a general introduction to the world of Ultima IV.
WISDOM.TXT contains "The Book of Mystic Wisdom", which explains the
system of magic and provides descriptions of the spells and reagents.

PDF versions of these books are included in the official download in
the EXTRA folder of the zip file.
As an added bonus this folder also includes a pdf of the offical 
Ultima IV cluebook.

An image of the cloth map from the original Ultima IV box is also
included in the EXTRA folder.
