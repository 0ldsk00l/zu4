Ultima 4 Music Re-arrangement
v1.1

This is an alternate arrangement of Ultima 4's music.  I tried to use more
traditional intruments for each piece where possible.  This includes flute/banjo
for the wander theme, horns for the castles theme, choirs for the shrines, and
so on.

INSTALLATION:

   XU4:

      Extract/copy the contents of the xu4 sub-folder to your xu4 installation
      directory.

      Since xu4 makes use of OGG instead of MIDI files, these arrangements were
      recorded with the RealSound GS soundfont on the SoundBlaster Live.

   U4 UPGRADE:

      Two folders are included depending on the version of the upgrade patch
      installed.  You can determine which version depending on the presence or
      lack of LARGE.XMI.

      Version 1.2 or greater - with LARGE.XMI:

         Make sure the U4 Upgrade is installed FIRST.  Extract/copy the contents
         of u4up-12 to your Ultima 4 directory.  This should replace LARGE.XMI
         and ULTIMA.COM.

         NOTE: ULTIMA.COM is being replaced because the size of LARGE.XMI is
         hard-coded within the binary.

      Older versions / Music patch only - without LARGE.XMI:

         Make sure the U4 Upgrade or music patch is installed FIRST.  Extract/
         copy the contents of u4up-old to your Ultima 4 directory.  This should
         replace several individual XMI files.
