XU4 DATA FILE TOOLS
===================

$Id: tools.txt 1749 2004-02-28 19:51:22Z andrewtaylor $

The xu4 engine includes a number of tools for converting the various
Ultima IV data files into easy-to-use formats and back.  With these
tools, you don't need a detailed understanding of the Ultima IV
internals to make U4 mods.  Better yet, the mods should work equally
well with xu4 and the original Ultima IV for DOS.

Rather than create GUI file editors for each type, I've chosen to
simply write small utilities to convert the data files into standard
file formats.  After all, there are better image/text/xml editors out
there than I can possibly hope to write.


u4enc & u4dec
---------------

These two tools are used with the graphics used in the game including
the character set, the tiles, the borders that surround the main play
screen and the shrine visions.  They convert the images from the U4
internal image formats to the .PNG file format, which should be easy
to modify in paint programs like Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, or The
Gimp.

They work equally well with the original 16 color EGA graphics files
and the 256 color VGA upgrade files.  The "u4vga.pal" file must be in
the current directory when converting VGA files.

Ultima IV uses three different algorithms to encode its graphics:
"lzw", used for the introduction graphics, "rle", used for most
in-game graphics, and finally "raw", which is used only for the tile
set and character set images.

You must specify which algorithm to use, and it must be the correct
one or else you'll get a corrupt image.

Use "rle" with with the following files:

start.ega                compassn.ega
courage.ega              honesty.ega
honor.ega                humility.ega
justice.ega              love.ega
sacrific.ega             spirit.ega
truth.ega                valor.ega
rune_0.ega               rune_1.ega
rune_2.ega               rune_3.ega
rune_4.ega               rune_5.ega

And also with these files, found only in the VGA upgrade:

rune_6.ega               rune_7.ega
rune_8.ega

Use "lzw" with the following files:

title.ega                tree.ega
portal.ega               outside.ega
inside.ega               wagon.ega
gypsy.ega                abacus.ega
honcom.ega               valjus.ega
sachonor.ega             spirhum.ega
animate.ega

And finally, use "raw" with the following files:

charset.ega              shapes.ega

Examples:
C:\xu4> u4dec rle START.EGA START.PNG            (to convert to PNG)
C:\xu4> u4enc rle START.PNG START.EGA            (to convert back to U4 format)
C:\xu4> u4dec lzw TITLE.EGA TITLE.PNG            (to convert to PNG)
C:\xu4> u4enc lzw TITLE.PNG TITLE.EGA            (to convert back to U4 format)
C:\xu4> u4dec raw CHARSET.EGA CHARSET.PNG 8 2048 (to convert to PNG)
C:\xu4> u4enc raw CHARSET.PNG CHARSET.EGA        (to convert back to U4 format)
C:\xu4> u4dec raw SHAPES.EGA SHAPES.PNG 16 4096  (to convert to PNG)
C:\xu4> u4enc raw SHAPES.PNG SHAPES.EGA          (to convert back to U4 format)


tlkconv
-------

tlkconv converts the Ultima IV .TLK files into XML and back.  The
conversation text can be changed, but it must follow the basic Ultima
IV conversation structure: response for each of the standard questions
("name", "look", "job", and "health") a pronoun (he, she, it, etc.),
two addtional four letter keywords and the responses they trigger, and
finally a question and the responses for yes and no answers.
Attributes also specify when the question is asked, whether the answer
to the question will affect the players humility, and how likely the
talker is to turn away in mid-conversation.

This should also make internationalizing most of the NPC convsations
easier.  Note that both xu4 and Ultima IV for DOS only support
US-ASCII characters (xu4 may support ISO-8859-1 or even Unicode in the
future).

Example:
C:\xu4> tlkconv --toxml BRITAIN.TLK BRITAIN.XML        (to convert to XML)
C:\xu4> tlkconv --fromxml BRITAIN.XML BRITAIN.TLK      (to convert back to U4 format)
