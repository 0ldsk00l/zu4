# Ultima IV Recreated

This is a cleaned up, modernized fork of "xu4".

### WARNING
This codebase is probably broken in a lot of ways.
I am not looking for code contributions right now,
as I am trying to realize my vision for the project
before accepting outside assistance. However, any
suggestions or bug reports are welcome.

#### How to Compile
Currently, the following dependencies are required:
libsdl2, libxml2
```
make
```

#### Where to Get Game Files

#### Project Goals
* Greatly simplify the codebase
* Remove all external dependencies from the engine
* Make the engine simple to plug into any framework
* Convert from ugly C++ to beautiful C
* Make it "Just Work"
* Come up with a new name to avoid confusion
